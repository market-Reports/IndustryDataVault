The demand for both residential and commercial buildings is on the rise, leading to greater requirements for door frames. Technological advancements and the adoption of innovative materials such as fiberglass and composite have further enhanced the market's potential. By improving energy efficiency and aesthetic appeal, these developments are contributing to the market’s growth.</p> <p>According to recent projections, the door frame market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.8% from 2024 to 2032. The market size is anticipated to reach USD 12 billion by 2032, up from USD 7.6 billion in 2024. This substantial growth can be attributed to the increasing residential and commercial construction activities, along with a rising focus on customized door frames that cater to specific consumer preferences.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>Furthermore, the increasing renovation and remodeling activities globally are expected to propel the demand for door frames.
